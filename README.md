# NY_DEC_PWS
Code for compiling New York State's Department of Environmental Conservation into feature for ingestion into Geoconnex

The Python code can be used to aggregate the geojsons that are displayed at: https://water.ny.gov/doh2/applinks/waterqual/#/waterMaps into appropriately attributed Geoconnex features. The exact features are found: https://water.ny.gov/doh2/applinks/waterqual/assets/PWS_GeoJson1.json and subsequently 2, and 3 at the end of the URL.
